# JOSAA scraper
This project is a web-scraper that accesses the official <a href="https://josaa.admissions.nic.in/applicant/seatmatrix/openingclosingrankarchieve.aspx">JOSAA website</a> to obtain the opening and closing ranks for all the academic programmes offered in JOSAA counselling 2024 along with the number of seats available in them.

This was made with the intention to provide an idea of the options available for a candidate at their respective rank and help them to make a better and more well-informed decision for their branch and college.

To access the opening and closing ranks, download the file `josaa24.csv`.
To access the seat matrix, download the file `seat_matrix_25.xlsx`

### Warning:
For IITs the ranks diaplayed are the <b>JEE Advance ranks</b> and for all colleges in NIT+ system, <b>JEE Mains ranks</b> are considered.
Do <b>not</b> download thev  `seat_matrix_25.csv` as it would be harder to navigate in.
